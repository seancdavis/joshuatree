		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:

<blockquote>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>

...or something like this:

<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>

As a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href="http://localhost/dev_rocktreedesign.com/wp-admin/">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content. Have fun!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[rocktree Design offers an array of cost-effective services to help support your web and print marketing. Here's a synopsis of our services, but feel free to dive in to each one to learn more.
<h2>Web Design</h2>
Maybe your website is really great, but it's just missing <em>something</em>. Maybe it needs a slight design refresh. Or maybe you need to wipe it completely and start from scratch. No matter the case, we can help.
<h2>App Development</h2>
If you need to interact more intimately with your web visitors and/or customers, you may want to pursue a web application, and we're here to help.
<h2>Web Analytics</h2>
So you have your site or app up and running. What now? Now you need to know how well it's performing, and that's where we come in.
<h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
It's not easy to appear among the top search results. Whether you already have a website up and running, or even if you are beginning a redesign project, now is the time to consider how you can bump your site up in the search results, ultimately translating to dollars and cents to you.
<h2>Social Media Management &amp; Analytics</h2>
Social media is a great way to stay engaged with your fans or customers, but it can be overwhelming. Where do you spend your time? What do you say?
<h2>Email Newsletters</h2>
When combined with a solid website, your newsletters can be huge in keeping your customers informed and growing your business. But there's a fine line between a newsletter being effective and annoying, so let's work together to keep you on the <em>effective</em> side of that line.
<h2>Marketing Collateral</h2>
Just like your website, whether you need a refresh of your printed materials, or whether you need new materials created, we can help!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Web design doesn't just mean creating a new website from scratch. There are many levels of web design, and we can help find the level that fits your needs. Let's move through the levels, starting with the largest.
<h2>New Site</h2>
As you probably guessed, building a new site can be a pretty extensive project. People interested in this tend to either not have a website yet or believe their website is just not working. We'll sit down with you and learn everything we can about your business. From there we'll create a site plan that will leave you with the greatest return on investment. Then it's time to get to work!
<h2>Site Redesign</h2>
What if you already have a site populated with content, but the design needs to be updated? That's the perfect opportunity to challenge the sitemap (or site structure) of your site. We can bring new ideas to the table, while examining and challenging what you already have in place to ensure it's maximizing your site's potential.
<h2>Design Refresh</h2>
Of course, your site structure may already be solid, and you just need to update your look and feel. If you have something in mind, great! We'll build it. Otherwise, we'll work together to come up with a cost-effective solution.
<h2>Plugins &amp; New Functionality</h2>
And finally, maybe your design and structure are working just fine, but you need to add some functionality to your site. Whether it's an FAQ page, a contact form, or a photo gallery, we'll work to integrate the new functionality seamlessly into your existing site.
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
You know what you need? Great! Well, it doesn't really matter. Contact us and together we'll figure out the right path for you and your site.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">What's the difference between a web</span><em style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">site</em><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> and a web </span><em style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">app?</em></h2>
That's a good question. Though definitions vary, a <em>web app</em> is really just a website that focuses on visitor interaction. In other words, if I want an <em>About Us </em>webpage, then I have a website. But if I want users to manage a customers database (in other words, customer relationship management), then I want a web app.
<h2>No, really, what's the difference?</h2>
To you, the customer, the difference boils down to functionality, but we'll take care of worry about the difference. You just need to fill out the contact form with some details, and we'll be in touch and decide what's best for you.
<h2>Native iOS and Android Applications</h2>
Without getting too deep into the weeds, we feel it's necessary you remain informed. Native applications are not the same as web applications. (at the moment) We are not native app creators. But don't turn away! Many times people believe they <em>need</em> a native iOS or Android application when really a web application would cover the functionality while being much more cost-effective.

		<title>Web Analytics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So you have a website. How many people visit it every day? At what time? Who are they? Where do they live? What language are they using in their browser? How did they get to your site? What do they search on your site? What's your most popular blog post? Why?

Those are weird questions. But every single one of them can be answered after studying the analytics of your site.
<h2>The Tool</h2>
We use Google Analytics to track our clients' sites. Why? Well, it's free and we're all about being your valuable partners. But it's not just that it's free. It's also really, really powerful. We can answer each of those question above without purchasing anything from Google (except maybe our freedom).
<h2>What Makes Us Different?</h2>
Let's get one thing straight. In this technology-ingested world, it's really not that difficult to figure out how to set up Google Analytics on your site. Anyone could do that for you in a few minutes. Then they could hand you a giant stack of standard reports every month. And then what?

We feel there are two things that make your investment in rocktree Design worthwhile.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Custom Reports</h3>
First, we set up <em>custom reports</em>. We don't look at and hand you a thousand reports every month. Instead, there are a few select reports we feel give us the majority of the insight into your site's success. So we choose to use our time wisely (you know, that's your <em>value</em>).<i>
</i>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
Yes Google makes it super easy for you to obtain reports on your site's traffic. But they don't read them and then tell you what you should do to make your site better. We do. After setting up the custom reports, we let you know what the numbers actually mean, and then we give you suggestions for boosting those numbers.
<h2>Many Options</h2>
We say it again and again. But really, we want you to succeed. And part of that success means spending money where it makes sense. We offer several web analytics options, so give us a shout and let's find the one that's right for you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are a lot of websites, right? And there's probably at least a few like yours. So how do you get put above all the other sites in search results? Without boring you with the details, let's just say it's not easy.
<h2>Why?</h2>
The vast majority of website traffic comes from search engines. The numbers are always changing, so instead of sharing them, think about your personal tendencies. How many times have you clicked past the first page of search results? I can't remember the last time I did. And in most cases, if you find what you want in the first three or four results, you'll never even scroll down the page.

What that really means is optimizing your site has a direct correlation to your site's success. And for most people that translates directly to income.
<h2>The Magic Formula</h2>
Have you heard about the magic formula to get you to the top of the search results?

That's because it doesn't exist.

Making your way to the top of the results isn't easy. We'll work with you using Google's own set of best practices to help get you to the top of the search results. One thing is clear whether you work with rocktree or another firm - no one can guarantee a top spot.
<h2>Site-Wide or Page-by-Page</h2>
Like web analytics, we've worked to create several options for SEO. We want to keep your budget in mind, while working hard to get you to the top of the search results. Get in touch with us and we'll discuss your options.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Social media is everywhere. There's no denying it, and in many cases, there's no avoiding it either. Whether you're running a blog or a corporate website, social media is going to help your site succeed.
<h2>Management</h2>
You recognize the influence of social media, but maybe you don't have time to take on managing it. We'll take it over. No, we're probably not experts in your industry. But what we can do is learn from you and strategically engage your customers. Together, we'll build your brand and hopefully your pocketbook, too.
<h2>Monitoring</h2>
How many people are you reaching (or influencing) with your social media interactions? You won't know unless you monitor your accounts. Even if you're managing your accounts, we can tell you how well you're doing.
<h2>Web Analytics</h2>
Social media monitoring is even more powerful when combined with web analytics, and specifically campaign tracking. We tend to group the two together and provide you with powerful action items that will grow you interaction and your business.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How many email newsletters do you delete every day? Why?

How many do you read? Why?
<h2>The Line</h2>
There's a fine line between an email newsletter campaign being effective and being annoying. Your brand isn't too annoy your customer (that's a guess). Finding the <em>effective</em> side of that line can be tricky. Together, we'll analyze your brand, customers, and goals and ultimately create a powerful newsletter that brings people back to your site.
<h2>The Application</h2>
We're most familiar with Constant Contact, but we've worked with other applications before, and don't mind working in whatever you've chosen. What we're looking for is an application with built-in, powerful analytics at the right price point for you.
<h2>Design</h2>
Built-in templates that come with email marketing applications are simple and easy to maintain, but that's not you. You want something that suits you perfectly. And our custom design should fit into any email marketing application.
<h2>Analytics</h2>
You only know how effective your campaign is if you measure it using your application. Even if you want to be in full-control of your newsletter, we can help you in measuring its success. This is even more powerful when combined with web analytics. Ask us.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[All we talk about here at rocktree is web, web and web. But marketing happens offline, too.
<h2>Brand Consistency</h2>
Your brand needs to be consistent across all mediums. If you've just redesigned your website, well, your printed materials should follow soon after to use a similar look and feel. You want to be easily recognizable to your customers and fans.
<h2>Back Online</h2>
Print marketing is still a great way to get people back on your site. Slap your website on every piece of collateral you publish, and someone is bound to get online and check it out.
<h2>Design</h2>
Whether we're designing to fit a developed brand look and feel or creating a new one, we'll work from the ground up to create a powerful design for you pieces.
<h2>Content</h2>
You can know you want a new collateral piece, but not be sure of its content. Even though we're probably not subject matter experts in your field, we can position you to think strategically to create powerful, concise and effective statements.]]></content:encoded>
